# Professor-DS

Designed and implemented a class to represent professors and scheduled courses

▪  A professor is described by:

▪   Name 

▪   Courses the professor is allowed to teach 

▪   Courses the professor is scheduled to teach during the semesters 

▪  Operations on professors:

▪   Add/Remove a course the professor is allowed to teach (e.g. ISI300)

▪   Add/Remove a course for a semester as a pair <semester,course> (e.g. Sp19,ISI300)

▪   Remove all scheduled courses for a given semester

▪   Remove all scheduled courses for a given course

▪  Note:

▪ A professor can be scheduled to teach a course for a semester only if the course being 
assigned to the prof is one of those the professor is allowed to teach
